================

            

Stops one or more AWS EC2 VMs. Can be hooked up to a schedule to stop VMs continually at certain times of day.


 


Depends on the AWSPowerShell module: [http://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AWSPowerShell/](http://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AWSPowerShell/)


 


Adding more text here because Script Center said my description was too short...

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
